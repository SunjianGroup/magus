1. read_seeds:
 ase vasp-xdatcar only work on fractional coordinates
2. min_lattice in check_cell and in generate should be discriminate
 now only judge if angles between 45-135
3. GAP
4. CI\CD
5. DP select 
6. Lattice match    # Update 20230904:
 A similar function in interface system is applied. 'reconstruct.utils.InterfaceMatcher'
7. XRD
8. topology random
9. HanYu de dai ma  # :?
10. auto guess volume(calculate stress with harmonic potential?)
11. How to merge atoms and repair for formula in molecule crystals?
 I applied some functions just to delete the whole molecule if atoms are too close.
 And add a whole molecule to meet the formula requirement.
 'populations.individuals.ConfinedBulk'
 It's a temporary version and the codes need reorganization.
 A new Individual base class for molecule crystals is needed.
